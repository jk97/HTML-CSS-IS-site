<li><h4>Ichika Orimura</h4></li>
<img src="http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/108068.jpg" width ="100" height = "200">
<p>The male lead of the show, Ichika Orimura is a freshmen highschool boy who goes to the IS Academy,which is an all-girl school.
How does he get in? Somehow, out of all the males in the world, he is the only one who is able to pilot an Infinite Stratos (IS). 
After entering the school, he is reunited with his old childhood friends as well as making new ones ( all females of course), but to the girls, it's not just
friendship with Orimura that they seek, it's his heart they each want. However, Orimura, oblivious of their feelings, has no clue what's going on when he gets slapped, hit with 
a wooden sword, and scolded at. He pilots a <a href="byakushiki.html">Byakushiki</a>, his own personal IS.
</p>

<li><h4>Houki Shinonono</h4></li>

away to be protected from those who targetted Tabane for inventning the IS. After many years not seeing each other, Houki met Ichika at the IS academy only to find that most of the girls surround 
Ichika to make him their lover.Houki is a tsundere who has definitely fallen in love with her childhood friend. She did not have an personal IS until later in the season; now she pilots the <a href="akatsubaki.html">Akatsubaki<a/>.

Cecilia Alcott is a representative contender from England. Acting all elegant and haughty, Cecilia first met Ichika in her class. At first she felt insulted by Ichika, enough to challege him to a duel.Both characters were fighting for the 
seat of class representative.They hated each other for that short time. After the match,which resulted in Cecilia's victory, Cecilia, for some uknown reason, began to fall in love with Ichika. She, though, has a different approach of
making Ichika fall in love with her, but I shall not go into that, for some viewers may deem it inappropriate. She pilots <a href="bluetears.html">Blue Tears<a/>, her own personal IS.
